// rather than silently filing years of training under the wrong lift. Shown on both routine-scan
// review screens (the member's own, and the trainer panel's) so a human makes that one call
// instead — picking a candidate swaps it in everywhere that exercise appears in the routine;
// "None of these" just leaves it as the custom exercise it would have been anyway.
