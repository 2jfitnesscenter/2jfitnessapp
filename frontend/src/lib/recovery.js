// Muscle recovery — a 0-100% "how ready is this muscle" estimate per muscles.js slug, shown on
// Home, Stats and the /recovery detail screen. This is a documented estimate, not a
// physiological model (same caveat the reference this was modeled on states about itself).
//
// Method: walk the last WINDOW_DAYS of S.workouts. Every DONE, reps-mode set (time/cardio sets
// are left out entirely, same as the reference this follows) contributes
//   musclesOf(ex)[slug] * (reps / STANDARD_REPS) * intensityOf(set)
// to that muscle's fatigue — reusing muscles.js's existing primary(1)/secondary(0.4, configurable
// in Settings) weighting, reps/STANDARD_REPS standing in for time-under-tension, and
// intensityOf() scaling a set up or down by how hard it was actually taken (RIR/RPE) — a set
// logged at RIR 0 fatigues more than the same reps at RIR 5, an unrated set (most imported
// history) stays neutral. Each contribution then decays exponentially from the moment that
// workout ended, at a half-life that depends on the *muscle's own size* — big, slow-recovering
// muscles (back, quads, hamstrings, glutes) get a longer half-life than smaller ones (chest,
// shoulders, arms, calves, core), so the same fatigue level clears faster on a bicep than on a
// hamstring. Recovery% = 100 × (1 − fatigue/MAX_FATIGUE), clamped 0-100.

// see recoveryColor below). Deriving both from one exponential decay keeps the curve genuinely
// continuous (never a hard jump) while still landing on the brief's literal windows: solving
// 100×(1−0.5^(hours/halfLife)) = 99.5 for a fully-fatigued muscle at hours = WINDOW_HOURS gives
