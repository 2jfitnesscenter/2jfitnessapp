// Bunker.jsx's own local, per-device map of "which members THIS exact kiosk instance already
// has a valid bunker token for" — { [uid]: { token, name, exp } }, kept in React state, never
// persisted to localStorage (a shared physical kiosk is exactly the wrong place to leave a
// readable credential for whoever left it minimized — see Bunker.jsx's own doc comment for the
// full rationale). Extracted here, not inline, purely so it's unit-testable: this project's
// vitest has no DOM environment, so a component-level test of the actual tap-to-resume click
// isn't possible, but the pure "what survives a board refresh" rule is.
//
// A credential survives a board refresh only if its member's card is still on the board (still
// checked in — minimizing never removes a card from the board, see api/bunker/routes.js's own
// comment on why there is no minimize endpoint) OR they are the currently open panel (a board
// reconciliation must never interrupt an actively-training session just because of a timing
// gap between two polls). Anyone whose card disappeared for any other reason — finished,
// admin force-closed, timed out idle (api/bunker/store.js's IDLE_TTL) — loses their local
// credential; the next tap on that name, if it ever reappears, asks for the PIN again.
