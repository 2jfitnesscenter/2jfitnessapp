// group's own `sg` value, which is an opaque uid() the routine/progression engine mints, not a
// stable letter or index. Reading by first-appearance order is what makes the same group keep
// the same color across a re-render or a reorder that doesn't change which units exist, and
// it's why routine A's own "group A" and routine B's own "group A" both read as the same color
// — the whole point of labeling by position rather than by id.
//
// The palette draws only from index.css's existing named tokens (already themed for light and
// dark) and deliberately skips every color already reserved for something else in this app:
// green is the single accent (--acc) and would make a superset look like "the current
// selection"; orange is unavailable/warning (see e.g. "No disponible ahora mismo"); red is
// error/danger; yellow is PR/record. Reusing any of those for a superset group would make that
// group's color lie about what it means.

 *   - `{ letter, pos, size, token }` for one that is: `letter` is the group's own A/B/C…,
 *     `pos` is this item's 1-based position inside the group (so "A1"/"A2" is
 *     `letter + pos`), `size` is the group's total exercise count, and `token` indexes into
