// How a member wants the live workout presented — the PREFERENCES layer, kept apart from the
// two layers a session actually carries (see views/Workout.jsx):
//   · prescription — entry.target (a snapshot of the routine slot, trainer note included) and
//     entry.plan (what the routine's progression policy decided, and why)
//   · result       — entry.sets (what was really lifted)
// Nothing read here is ever written into S.active; switching any of it mid-session only changes
// how the same session is drawn.
//
// Every key is optional in S and read with its default here, in one place, so a profile saved
// before a preference existed keeps exactly the behaviour it had (the detailed set list, images
// and sounds on, nothing auto-completed). New profiles get their own starting point from
// NEW_PROFILE_DEFAULTS instead — written once, the moment the post-registration wizard marks the
// profile onboarded, never onto an existing account.
