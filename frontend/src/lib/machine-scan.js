// Turns a scanned gym machine's raw { name, nameEn } (api/lib/machine-scan.js) into candidate
// library exercises to confirm — reuses import-csv.js's own matchExerciseCandidates(), the

// difference: routine-scan silently auto-applies a single clean match (asking about every line
// of a multi-exercise scan would be tedious), while this flow always surfaces at least that one
// match for a tap-to-confirm — the entire point of a dedicated "scan one machine" screen is
// precision over throughput, since a wrongly-filed duplicate is exactly the bug being fixed.
