// A short, in-app version history — condensed from CHANGELOG.md (the full, prose version kept
// in the repo for GitHub) down to one line per change, no explanations. Item strings go through
// t() wherever they're rendered, same as every other UI string, so translators can pick them up;
// a version's own `date` is a plain ISO string formatted with the viewer's locale at render time.
//
// The 'dev' entry has no version number on purpose: it's everything shipped on top of v1.2.3
// that hasn't been tagged as a release yet, listed so "what changed recently" has an honest
// answer even before that's a formal version — update it as things land, and fold it into a new
// numbered entry (with today's date) once a release is actually cut.
